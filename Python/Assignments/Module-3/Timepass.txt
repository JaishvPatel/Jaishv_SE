I do NOT release these programs so that you " the End-user " can benefit from it in terms of using software or any other of these releases without buying the required licenses .
R@1n , however , believes that everyone should have the option to test and backup their program and be able to run it without any problems .
Further , I do NOT in any way condone the spreading of this program , in other words I do NOT spread the releases to any websites , P2P networks or any other public available location .
I urge that this releases should not be spread like that at all .
This is my first text .
